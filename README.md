# Common types project

This project provides enum snippets of common types.
This is not meant to be a library, but you should copy the files you need.

The only reason there's a csproj file in the snippet folder is to help development, making it possible to build and get syntax highlighting.

## Supported types

- Country codes: ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
   - Format: `CountryCode` (2 letters) - `NumericValue`
- Currencies: ISO 4217
   - Format: `CurrencyCode` (3 letters) - `NumericValue`
